## Welcome to 170 Arbor Court

This is a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom townhouse. We have loved living here and are moving due to a change in work/school. The monthly HOA Fee ($351 a month) covers property tax; water, sewer, trash and recycling; upkeep of grounds and snow removal; maintenance of roof, siding, and exterior of building; replacement and repair of all original appliances, plumbing, and furnace as needed; 24/7 emergency maintenance; free use of the clubhouse with reservation; and free admission to the Omaha Botanical Lauritzen Gardens. Call, text, or email Parker if you have any questions!
